This project is designed to [provide a brief description of your project's purpose]. Follow the instructions below to set up the environment and install dependencies.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11.9 (Make sure Python is installed on your system)
- pip (Python package installer)

## Setup

### Step 1: Create a Virtual Environment

1. Open a terminal or command prompt in the root directory of the project.
2. Run the following command to create a virtual environment named `.venv`:

```bash
   python -m venv .venv
```

   This will create a folder named `.venv` in your project directory, which will contain a self-contained Python environment.

### Step 2: Activate the Virtual Environment

- **On Windows**:

   ```bash
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

- **On macOS and Linux**:

   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

   Once activated, your command prompt should display the virtual environment's name, `.venv`, to indicate you are working inside the environment.

### Step 3: Install Requirements

With the virtual environment activated, install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` by running:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

This will install all the required packages specified for the project.
